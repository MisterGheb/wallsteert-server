# How to access?
You can access the swaggers by going to path "server_url"/docs

# Adding documentation for new apis
There is a python library [leangle](https://pypi.org/project/leangle/) which helps us to add description to our apis. You can do the following

1. Describe API Parameters
2. Describe API Responses
3. Describe Method Tags
4. Add schemas

First rest /auth/registration and then click on the authorise button in the top left.
Add `Bearer key` here is `key` is the authorisation token which you got after doing registration.
